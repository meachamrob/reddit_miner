reddit_miner
============

A simple python using MongoDB and Pymongo to perform text mining on Reddit.com. Since reddit stores its data in the form of a json document(yippee), its easier to apply text mining techniques and process them in a NoSQL databases, one of them being MongoDB(my favorite ;)))
